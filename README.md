Recommendations

The majority of the top Instagram influencers belong to the fashion or music industries. Film, acting, modelling, beauty, and lifestyle are among the top categories as well. The most following and engagement were found in fashion-related categories. As a result, the top category for Instagram influencers in the US should be regarded fashion.


Restrictions and Following Steps

Numerous subsets of the categories, such as "Fashion|Modeling|Beauty," might be found in more than one category because they included subsets. To totally disentangle these category subcategories, more research could be done. The Authentic engagement and Engagement average columns were difficult for me to plot.
